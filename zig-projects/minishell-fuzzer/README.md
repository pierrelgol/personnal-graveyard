Absolutely! Hereâ€™s the updated and refined version of your README for the `minishell-fuzzer` project, including a WIP section with features to be added:

# Minishell-Fuzzer

### ðŸš§ WARNING: Work In Progress ðŸš§

This project is still under development. While the core functionality is operational, it's not yet complete. To use the fuzzer, skip the readline part and treat your `argv` as the input "line" for your minishell. With print statements in your lexer or parser, you can observe how each token is parsed, which aids in debugging your minishell by testing thousands of random inputs.

---

## Description

**Minishell-Fuzzer** is a tool designed for fuzz testing your minishell implementation. Fuzz testing involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data to a program to uncover errors, vulnerabilities, and crashes.

Minishell-Fuzzer tests the parsing capabilities of your minishell by supplying it with random commands. It's not a comprehensive tester but a tool to enhance your ability to test and debug your implementation. Provide the absolute path to your executable along with a set of options, and `minishell-fuzzer` will launch your minishell and input a series of random commands.

---

## Usage

Before running the fuzzer, ensure you have the Zig compiler installed. You can download it from the [Zig website](https://ziglang.org/download/) or use your package manager:

```bash
brew install zig
```

Build the fuzzer for your platform:

```bash
zig build -p /path/to/build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

Run the fuzzer with the following command:

```bash
$> ./minishell-fuzzer [absolute_path_to_minishell] [options]
```

### Example

```bash
$> ./minishell-fuzzer $HOME/workspace/42/minishell -n 5 -l 10
```

### Options

- `-h` : Prints the help message.
- `-n` : Specifies the number of input lines to send to the minishell.
- `-l` : Defines the maximum length of commands per input line.

## Work In Progress (WIP)

### Features to be Added

- [x] **Core Functionality**: Basic fuzzy testing with random input generation.
- [ ] **Support for Relative Paths**: Allow testing with paths relative to the current directory.
- [ ] **Input Pattern Customization**: Allow users to specify custom patterns for input generation.
- [ ] **Error Logging**: Capture and log errors or crashes encountered during testing.
- [ ] **Configuration File Support**: Enable the use of configuration files for setting options.
- [ ] **Command Statistics**: Provide statistics on the types and frequency of commands tested.
- [ ] **Interactive Mode**: Develop an interactive mode for real-time input generation and testing.
