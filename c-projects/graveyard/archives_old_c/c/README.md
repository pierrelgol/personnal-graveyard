## Personnal workspace

This is my repo to learn, and train, it's not meant to be perfect code, the reason why it's lacking comments, it's because i want to maximise the raw ammount of code
to maximize the amount of erros i make, in order to improve faster, i also want to have bad code to be able as my skills grow to comeback and make improvement
