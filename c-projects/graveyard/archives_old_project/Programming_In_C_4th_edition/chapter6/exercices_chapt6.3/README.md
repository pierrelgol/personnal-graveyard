# 3. Program 6.2 permits only 20 responses to be entered. 

Modify that program so that any number of responses can be entered. So that
the user does not have to count the number of responses in the list, set up the
program so that the value 999 can be keyed in by the user to indicate that the
last response has been entered. (Hint: You can use the break statement here if
you want to exit your loop.)
