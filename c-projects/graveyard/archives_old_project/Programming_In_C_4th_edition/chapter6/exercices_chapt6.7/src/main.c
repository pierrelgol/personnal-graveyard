/*7. Prime numbers can also be generated by an algorithm known as the Sieve
of Eratosthenes. The algorithm for this procedure is presented here. Write a
program that implements this algorithm. Have the program find all prime numbers
up to n = 150. What can you say about this algorithm as compared to the ones
used in the text for calculating prime numbers? Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm
To Display All Prime Numbers Between 1 and n

Step 1: Define an array of integers P. Set all elements Pi to 0, 2 <= i <= n.
Step 2: Set i to 2.
Step 3: If i > n,the algorithm terminates.
Step 4: If Pi is 0, then i is prime.
Step 5: For all positive integer values of j, such that i x j â‰¤ n, set Pixj
to 1. Step 6: Add 1 to i and go to step 3. */
