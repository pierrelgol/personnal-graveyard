# 1. Type in and run the five programs presented in this chapter. Compare the output produced by each program with the output presented after each program in the text.
 ```C 
  1. 3.1 output = integerVar = 100
                  floatingVar = 331.790009
                  doubleVar = 8.440000e+11
                  doubleVar = 8.44e+11
                  charVar = W
                  boolVar = 0;
                  
  2. 3.2 output = a - b = 98
                  b * c = 50
                  a / c = 4
                  a + b * c = 150
                  a * b + c * d = 300

  3. 3.3 output = 6 + a / 5 * b = 16
                  a / b * b = 24
                  c / d * d = 25.000000
                  -a = -25
                  
  4. 3.4 output = a = 25, b = 5, c = 10, and d = 7
                  a % b = 0
                  a % c = 5
                  a % d = 4
                  a / d * d + a % d = 25
                  
  5. 3.5 output = 123.125000 assigned to an int produces 123
                  -150 assigned to a float produces -150.000000
                  -150 divided by 100 produces -1.000000
                  -150 divided by 100.0 produces -1.500000
                  (float) -150 divided by 100 produces -1.500000# new_project_template
