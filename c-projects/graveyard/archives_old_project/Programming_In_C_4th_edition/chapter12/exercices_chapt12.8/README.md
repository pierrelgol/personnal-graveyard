# 8. Write a macro IS_DIGIT that gives a nonzero value if a character is a digit '0' through '9'. Use this macro in the definition of another macro IS_SPECIAL, which gives a nonzero result if a character is a special character; that is, not alphabetic and not a digit. Be certain to use the IS_ALPHABETIC macro developed in exercise 7.
