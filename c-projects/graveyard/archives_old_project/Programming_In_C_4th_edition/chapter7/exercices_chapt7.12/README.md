# 12. A matrix M with i rows, j columns can be transposed into a matrix N having j rows and i columns by simply setting the value of Na,b equal to the value of Mb,a for all relevant values of a and b.

a. Write a function transposeMatrix() that takes as an argument a 4 × 5 matrix
and a 5 × 4 matrix. Have the function transpose the 4 × 5 matrix and store the
results in the 5 × 4 matrix. Also write a main() routine to test the function.

b. Using variable-length arrays, rewrite the transposeMatrix() function
developed in exercise 12a to take the number of rows and columns as arguments,
and to transpose the matrix of the specified dimensions.
