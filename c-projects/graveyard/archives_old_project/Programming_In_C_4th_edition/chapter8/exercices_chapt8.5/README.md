# 5. Write a function called clockKeeper() that takes as its argument a dateAndTime structure as defined in this chapter. The function should call the timeUpdate() function, and if the time reaches midnight, the function should call the dateUpdate function to switch over to the next day. Have the function return the updated dateAndTime structure.
