# 4. Write a function called removeEntry() to remove an entry from a linked list. The sole argument to the procedure should be a pointer to the list. Have the function remove the entry after the one pointed to by the argument. (Why canâ€™t you remove the entry pointed to by the argument?) You need to use the special structure you set up in exercise 3 to handle the special case of removing the first element from the list.
