# Insertion Sort

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of Insertion Sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of Insertion Sort is O(1) because it operates directly on the input array and does not require additional space proportional to the input size.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros                                                      | Cons                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Simple implementation                                     | Inefficient for large datasets                   |
| Efficient for small datasets                              | Quadratic time complexity in the worst case      |
| Stable sorting algorithm                                  | Not suitable for parallel processing             |
| In-place sorting algorithm                                | May require a lot of shifting for large datasets |
| Adaptive algorithm (efficient for partially sorted arrays)|                                                  |
