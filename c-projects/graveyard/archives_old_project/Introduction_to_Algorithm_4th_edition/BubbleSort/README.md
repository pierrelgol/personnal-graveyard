# Bubble Sort

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements
in the array. Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they
are in the wrong order. This process is repeated for each element in the array,
resulting in a quadratic time complexity.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of Bubble Sort is O(1), as it operates directly on the
input array and does not require any additional space proportional to the input
size.
