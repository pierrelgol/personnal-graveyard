# Merge Sort

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of Merge Sort is O(n), where n is the number of elements
in the array. It requires additional space to store the temporary merged arrays
during the merging phase.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros                                                       | Cons                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Stable sorting algorithm                                   | Requires additional space for merging            |
| Efficient for large datasets                               | More complex implementation compared to simpler algorithms like Insertion Sort or Selection Sort |
| Guarantees worst-case time complexity of O(n log n)        | Not an in-place sorting algorithm                |
| Parallelizable with efficient implementations              |                                                  |
| Adaptive algorithm (efficient for partially sorted arrays) |                                                  |
