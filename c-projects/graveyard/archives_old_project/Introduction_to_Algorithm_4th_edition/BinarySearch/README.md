# Binary Search

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of Binary Search is O(log n), where n is the size of the
input array. Since Binary Search repeatedly halves the search space, it achieves
a logarithmic time complexity.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity of Binary Search is O(1), as it does not require any
additional space proportional to the input size. It performs the search directly
on the given array.
