# 6. Write a program that displays the contents of a file at the terminal 20 lines at a time. At the end of each 20 lines, have the program wait for a character to be entered from the terminal. If the character is the letter q, the program should stop the display of the file; any other character should cause the next 20 lines from the file to be displayed.
