# 5. Write a function called bit_test() that takes two arguments: an unsigned int and a bit number n. Have the function return 1 bit number n if it is on inside the word, and 0 if it is off. Assume that bit number 0 references the leftmost bit inside the integer. Also write a corresponding function called bit_set() that takes two arguments: an unsigned int and a bit number n. Have the function return the result of turning bit n on inside the integer.
