# 3. Write a function elapsed_time that takes as its arguments two time structures and returns a time structure that represents the elapsed time (in hours, minutes, and seconds)
between the two times. So the call elapsed_time (time1, time2) where time1
 represents 3:45:15 and time2 represents 9:44:03, should return a time structure
 that represents 5 hours, 58 minutes, and 48 seconds. Be careful with times that
 cross midnight.
