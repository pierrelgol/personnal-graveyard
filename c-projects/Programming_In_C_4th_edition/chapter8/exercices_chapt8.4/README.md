# 4. If you take the value of N as computed in exercise 2 :

subtract 621,049 from it, and then take that result modulo 7, you get a number
from 0 to 6 that represents the day of the week (Sunday through Saturday,
respectively) on which the particular day falls. For example, the value of
N computed for August 8, 2004, is 732,239 as derived previously. 732,239 −
621,049 gives 111,190, and 111,190 % 7 gives 2, indicating that this date falls
on a Tuesday. Use the functions developed in the previous exercise to develop
a program that displays the day of the week on which a particular date falls.
Make certain that the program displays the day of the week in English (such
as “Monday”).
