# 5. A doubly linked list is a list in which each entry contains a pointer to
the preceding entry in the list as well as a pointer to the next entry in the
list. Define the appropriate structure definition for a doubly linked list entry
and then write a small program that implements a small doubly linked list and
prints out the elements of the list.
