# “1. Type in and run the 15 programs presented in this chapter. Compare the output produced by each program with the output presented after each program in the text.”
```C
1.  Program10.1 output = count = 10, x = 10

2.  Program10.2 output = Q Q/ /( (

3.  Program10.3 output = i1 = 5, i2 = 12, *p1 = 5, *p2 = 5

4.  Program10.4 output = Today's date is 9/25/15.

5.  Program10.5 output = i1 = 100, *pointers.p1 = 100i2 = -97, *pointers.p2 = -97

6.  Program10.6 output = 200  300

7.  Program10.7 output = 100200300

8.  Program10.8 output = Before the call to test i = 50After the call to test i = 100

9.  Program10.9 output = i1 = -5, i2 = 66i1 = 66, i2 = -5i1 = -5, i2 = 66

10. Program10.10 output =  Enter value to locate: 200Found 200.

11. Program10.11 output =  The sum is 21

12. Program10.12 output =  The sum is 21

13. Program10.13 output =  A string to be copied.So is this.

14. Program10.14 output =  A string to be copied.So is this

15. Program10.15 output =  17  0  8
