# 1. Type in and run the 12 programs presented in this chapter. Compare the output produced by each program with the output presented after each program in the text. Try experimenting with each program by keying in values other than those shown.
```C
  1. Program5.1 ouput = Type in your number: -100
                        The absolute value is 100

  2. Program5.2 ouput = Enter grade #1: 93
                        Enter grade #2: 63
                        Enter grade #3: 87
                        Enter grade #4: 65
                        Enter grade #5: 62
                        Enter grade #6: 88
                        Enter grade #7: 76
                        Grade average = 76.29
                        Number of failures = 2
                        
                        
  3. Program5.3 ouput = Enter your number to be tested: 2455
                        The number is odd.

  4. Program5.4 ouput = Enter your number to be tested: 1234
                        The number is even.
                        
  5. Program5.5 ouput = Enter the year to be tested: 1955
                        Nope, it's not a leap year.

  6. Program5.6 ouput = Please type in a number: 1121
                        Sign = 1

  7. Program5.7 ouput = Enter a single character:
                        &
                        It's a special character.

  8. Program5.8 ouput = Type in your expression.
                        123.5 + 59.3
                        182.80
                        
  9. Program5.8A ouput = Type in your expression.
                         123.5 + 59.3
                         182.80

                        
  10. Program5.9 ouput = Type in your expression.
                         178.99 - 326.8
                         -147.81
                        
  11. Program5.10 ouput = 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47
