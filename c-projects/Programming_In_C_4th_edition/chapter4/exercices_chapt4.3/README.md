# 3. A triangular number can also be generated by the formula

 triangularNumber = n (n + 1) / 2 for any integer value of n . For example, the
 10th triangular number, 55, can be generated by substituting 10 as the value
 for n in the preceding formula. Write a program that generates a table of
 triangular numbers using the preceding formula. Have the program generate every
 fifth triangular number between 5 and 50 (that is, 5, 10, 15, ..., 50).
