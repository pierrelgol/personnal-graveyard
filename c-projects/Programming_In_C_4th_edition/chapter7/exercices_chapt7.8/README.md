# 8. An equation of the form

ax2 + bx + c = 0

is known as a quadratic equation. The values of a, b, and c in the preceding example represent constant values. So

4x2 - 17x - 15 = 0

represents a quadratic equation where a = 4, b = −17, and c = −15. The values
of x that satisfy a particular quadratic equation, known as the roots of the
equation, can be calculated by substituting the values of a, b, and c into the
following two formulas:

$$
x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}}
$$

If the value of b2−4ac, called the discriminant, is
less than zero, the roots of the equation, x1 and x2, are imaginary numbers.
Write a program to solve a quadratic equation. The program should allow the user
to enter the values for a, b, and c. If the discriminant is less than zero, a
message should be displayed that the roots are imaginary; otherwise, the program
should then proceed to calculate and display the two roots of the equation.
(Note: Be certain to make use of the squareRoot() function that you developed in
this chapter.)
