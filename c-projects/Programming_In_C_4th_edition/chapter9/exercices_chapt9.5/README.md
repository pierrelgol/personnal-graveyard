# 5. Write a function called findString() to determine if one character string exists inside another string. The first argument to the function should be the character string that is to be searched and the second argument is the string you are interested in finding. If the function finds the specified string, have it return the location in the source string where the string was found. If the function does not find the string, have it return âˆ’1. So, for example, the call

```C
 index = findString ("a chatterbox", "hat");
```

 searches the string "a chatterbox" for the string "hat" . Because "hat" does
exist inside the source string, the function returns 3 to indicate the starting
position inside the source string where "hat" was found.
