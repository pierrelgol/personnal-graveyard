# 7. Write a function called insertString() to insert one character string into another string. The arguments to the function should consist of the source string, the string to be inserted, and the position in the source string where the string is to be inserted. So, the call

```C
 insertString (text, "per", 10);
```

with text as originally defined in the previous exercise, results in the
character string "per" being inserted inside text , beginning at text[10] .
Therefore, the character string "the wrong person" is stored inside the text
array after the function returned.
