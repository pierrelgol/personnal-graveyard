# 6. Write a function called removeString() to remove a specified number of characters from a character string.

The function should take three arguments: the source string, the starting index
 number in the source string, and the number of characters to remove. So, if the
 character array text contains the string "the wrong son", the call removeString
 (text, 4, 6); has the effect of removing the characters “wrong” (the word
 “wrong” plus the space that follows) from the array text . The resulting string
 inside text is then "the son" .
