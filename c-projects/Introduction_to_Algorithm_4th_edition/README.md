# Introduction to Algorithm 4th edition

### Discalimer:

  In this repo I intend to implement in C every algorithm, contained in this
book, Therefore each folder will contain a particular algorithm implementation.
My implementation, might not be 100 % correct, it might contained unsafe code.

  The purpose isn't to have a fully optimised, production ready implementation
of each algorithm and more to learn, as I code, the fundamentals of computer 
science, algorithm and data structures.
